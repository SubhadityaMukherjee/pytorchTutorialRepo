- Cassava challenge kaggle

# Notes

- Optuna is really cool
- Just use a dataframe for classification datasets. Saves a lot of drama
- Cross entropy
- CSV logger is very convinent. Technically much nicer than tensorboard for small stuff. Tensorboard will be cooler with GANs and stuff I believe. Will try
